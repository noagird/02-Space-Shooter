 # Arcade Game Shooter
This is a quick arcade game shooter I made. All of the assets were not made by me.
## Implementation
Created using Godot 3.5

## Future Development
I look forward to creating sound effects for this game as it feels sort of baron without it. Though, I don't have the time to prioritize that as of right now.
